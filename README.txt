Hi! This is my first independent project based off a dungeons and dragons
campaign I am hosting for my friends. I'm not sure how to make .exe files 
quite yet so its easier for anybody to run this game, but I do plan on
figuring that out. 

The game runs on a simple 1, 2, 3 menu to make choices. The only combatant
right now is a slime. I do plan on adding more and making weapon damage types
matter. (e.g. A slime would be resistant to bludgeoning damage so only taking
half the total damage.)

For right now I don't plan on making this game too complex. I just wanted to
freshen up my C skills before the semester started and code something I was 
interested in. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Any helpful criticism is
more than welcome. I'd love to get better at this! I hope you have a great 
day!
	- Owen
